# The-Not-Too-Parallel-Virtual-Machine
This project describes a threaded implementation of the Not Too Parallel Virtual Machine (NTPVM) dispatcher, a simplified PVM system. The multithreaded implementation illustrates the interaction between threads and fork, providing a semirealistic application in which to explore complex thread interactions.
